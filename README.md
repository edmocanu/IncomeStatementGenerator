Welcome to the Income Statement Generator! Using only a spreadsheet, you can skip the hassle of creating an income statement from scratch by simply entering all the required info with no formatting needed.

Instructions:
1. Input all necessary information under the appropriate headers in the sheet called "Input". Currently, you can have up to 1000 Revenue and Expense accounts, but you can add more rows to the spreadsheet if required.
2. Select "Create statement" from the top menu and wait for the document to be created.
3. The link to the document containing the income statement will be posted in the sheet called "Output".
